	<h1>Customer Information</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Kirkman Road Veterinarian Clinic, Inc.</li>
			<li>Project: Re-Design</li>
			<li>Wed Designer: Jennifer L. Brown</li>
			<li>Document Purpose: Project Analysis</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2>Site Intent:</h2>
	
		<p>The goals for the site re-design is to make this clinic more appealing to anyone in need of a veterinarian clinic
		for there furry family member(s).  It is to be organized in a manner that is easy to understand by all ages, and 
		for new customers to find the information that they require in a timely organized fashion.</p>  
		<p>Currently there is so much going on within the site that it looks congested.  It is through this congestion
	 	and no clear direction that people(i.e. new customers) could become easily confused or frustrated within the site.  
	 	The site should represent how the clinic works and through the current site it gives the persona of disarray, 
	 	unorganized, clustered and not very clear meaning of what the clinic is trying to provide for there current 
		and potential customers.</p>
		 <p>I feel that the new site will give a new customer that calm feeling knowing that there is 
		 a clinic that will take care of there family member with the upmost care and love.  It is through the
		 goals of the site that there will be a navigation bar on the top that clearly delineates
	 	specifics like: Home, Services, About Us, and Clinic Information.  Then there will be 
	 	a clean header and footer that represents the clinic's orderly fashion.  The header of the page
	 	will include the Logo, and navigational menu.  The color pallet for the page will be more representative
	 	of the services rendered and to bring in customers with a calm color pallet.  It is through this concept that
	 	we will bring in more customers and help them to feel at ease regarding anything that need to happen 
	 	for there pet.</p>
	 
	 <h3>Competitive Analysis:</h3>
	 	<p>Based upon my research of the local community and within the web destinations of several other
	 	clinics within the surrounding cities, I think that this clinic should provide the user; user
	 	being new and current customer base to be the center of focus for this re-design.</p>
	 	<p>It is in the best interrest of the clinic to be competitive amongst there surrounding
	 	fellow veterinary clinics but also to stand out as the best one to take a pet for regular 
	 	and emergency services.</p>
	 	<p>Some of your fellow competitors within the are include:

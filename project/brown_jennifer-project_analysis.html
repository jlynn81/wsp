	<h1>Customer Information</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Kirkman Road Veterinarian Clinic, Inc.</li>
			<li>Project: Re-Design</li>
			<li>Wed Designer: Jennifer L. Brown</li>
			<li>Document Purpose: Project Analysis</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2>Site Intent:</h2>
	
		<p>The goals for the site re-design is to make this clinic more appealing to anyone in need of a veterinarian clinic
		for there furry family member(s).  It is to be organized in a manner that is easy to understand by all ages, and 
		for new customers to find the information that they require in a timely organized fashion.</p>  
		
		<p>Currently there is so much going on within the site that it looks congested.  It is through this congestion
	 	and no clear direction that people(i.e. new customers) could become easily confused or frustrated within the site.  
	 	The site should represent how the clinic works and through the current site it gives the persona of disarray, 
	 	unorganized, clustered and not very clear meaning of what the clinic is trying to provide for there current 
		and potential customers.</p>
		 
		 <p>I feel that the new site will give a new customer that calm feeling knowing that there is 
		 a clinic that will take care of there family member with the upmost care and love.  It is through the
		 goals of the site that there will be a navigation bar on the top that clearly delineates
	 	specifics like: Home, Services, About Us, and Clinic Information.  Then there will be 
	 	a clean header and footer that represents the clinic's orderly fashion.  The header of the page
	 	will include the Logo, and navigational menu.  The color pallet for the page will be more representative
	 	of the services rendered and to bring in customers with a calm color pallet.  It is through this concept that
	 	we will bring in more customers and help them to feel at ease regarding anything that need to happen 
	 	for there pet.</p>
	 
	 <h3>Competitive Analysis:</h3>
	 	<p id="competitive">Based upon my research of the local community and within the web destinations of several other
	 	clinics within the surrounding cities, I think that this clinic should provide the user; user
	 	being new and current customer base to be the center of focus for this re-design.
	 	It is in the best interrest of the clinic to be competitive amongst there surrounding
	 	fellow veterinary clinics but also to stand out as the best one to take a pet for regular 
	 	and emergency services.  Some of your fellow competitors within the are include:</p>
	 	
	 	<ol>
	 		<li><a href="http://www.westmonteanimalclinic.com">Westmonte Animal Clinic</a></li>			
	 		<li><a href="http://bayhillcathospital.com">Bay Hill Cat Hospital</a></li>

					<th>Competitive Analysis</th>

					<td>Website Keywords</td>

						kirkman road veterinary clinic, kirkman vet</td>

				<tr>	
					<td>Site Demographics</td>	
					<td>In accordance with a site query informational pull from Alexa Internet;
	 					the site over the past month has had a search traffic query rating of 47.87%.
	 					The site has some SEO issues that need to be fixed and they have broken links
	 					as well. There ranking amongst other search query's over the course of a month lead to a 
	 					lower percentage than cheap vets 32811 at which there percentage rate is 0.90%.
	 					Site demographics are utilized in the keyword search for not just the title but also for
	 					veterinary services within the respective location of the potential customer.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>	
					<td>Website Statistics pertaining to Vet Clinics</td>
					<td>Regarding website statistics and how they pertain to veterinary clinics, it is quite interesting to note
					that most veterinary clinics do not draw that much attention unless there is a real need, a need
					for information on how to care for there pet when they don't know how to.  Other veterinary sites 
					utilize a more organized structure that would be beneficial to the Kirkman Road site.  A site
					receives more hits when they are referred via word of mouth from other customers of the vet, 
					then the main content that gets the most looks is the Contact Us page and the Home page.  If a 
					potential customer really does there research then they will dig further. </tb> 
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Bad Practices</td>
					<td>This would include not incorporating the negative and the positive comments within there
					sites for that respective clinic or hospital.  Everyone had good points and bad points and we all don't
					want to take our animal to a bad doctor but posting the negative with the positive will give a potential 
					client/customer a better painted picture for an overall clinic and they can decide for themselves, what
					is right for there animal.  Another bad practice is redundancies in code, context of the site and formatting
					issues.</td>

	 <h5>Targeted Audience:</h5>
		<p>Our main target audience for the redesign project will be anyone who has from a domestic
		animal to an exotic pet.  We want to assist anyone with all of there family member needs, whether
		they have fur, feathers or scales.</p>

				<td>Emergency Services</td>
				<td>Kim calls the emergency hotline/contact number and gets a hold of after care management.
				Her cat was attacked by a coyote and needs assistance immediately.  The after care speciallist
				tells her to come in with her cat right away and she also notifies the on-call doctor of the situation.
				Kim arrives at the veterinarians office, where he cat goes in for x-rays and a full exam.
				Kim finds out that her cat has a splintered shoulder and will require surgery.  She opts for the
				amputation surgery, the cat is placed in a holding crate until morning and receives medicine to ease the pain overnight
				until surgery can be performed. Kim's cat goes through surgery, and Kim is extremely happy and refers
				all of her family and friends to Kirkman Road Veterinary Services for there extreme attention to detail,
				ability to calm her down in a crisis and there overall level of care given to her cat.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Online Appointment Scheduling</td>
				<td>Mike goes to the website to find the hours for the clinic so that he can make an appointment via phone.
				He later finds that next to the phone number link is a online appointment maker location.  Instead of calling to make an appointment, 
				he is able to make the appointment himself and not have to wait.  Customer is happy due to being able to make 
				his appointment prior to leaving work or the house without a phone and is able to carry on with the
				day.</td>

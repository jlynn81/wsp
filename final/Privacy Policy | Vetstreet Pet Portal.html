	  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <br>
      
	  <h3>PRIVACY STATEMENT</h3>
	  <p>The website you have accessed is powered by Vetstreet, Inc. 
(“Vetstreet”) on behalf of the veterinarian, animal hospital or animal 
clinic identified therein (the “Clinic”).  Vetstreet on behalf of itself
 and the Clinic is committed to protecting your privacy and developing 
technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. 
 This Privacy Statement applies to all Pet Portal websites, 
www.vetstreet.com, and any other website powered by Vetstreet, and 
governs data collection and usage.  We refer to all Pet Portal websites,
 www.vetstreet.com, and any other website powered by Vetstreet as the 
“Website.”  By using the Website, you consent to the data practices 
described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
	  <h3>COLLECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
	  <p>The Website may collect personally identifiable information, such 
as your email address, name, home or work address, or telephone number. 
 The Website also collects anonymous demographic information, which is 
not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, 
interests, and favorites.</p>
	  <p>There is also information about your computer hardware and 
software that is automatically collected by the Website.  This 
information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, 
access times, and referring website addresses.  This information is used
 by Vetstreet for the operation of the Website, the operation of the 
service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general 
statistics regarding use of the Website.</p>
	  <p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally 
identifiable information or personally sensitive data through any public
 message boards accessible through the Website, this information may be 
collected and used by others.</p>
	  <p>We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any websites 
you choose to link to from the Website so that you can understand how 
those websites collect, use and share your information.  We are not 
responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites 
outside of the Website and the Vetstreet family of websites.</p>
	  <h3>USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
	  <p>We may collect and may use your personal information to operate 
the Website, to provide various services to you and the Clinic, to 
maintain the quality of those services, and to provide general 
statistics regarding use of the Website.  We also may use your 
personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or 
services available from the Clinic, Vetstreet and its affiliates.  
Vetstreet may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about 
your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may 
be offered.</p>
	  <p>Vetstreet does not sell, rent, or lease its customer lists to 
third parties.  Vetstreet may from time to time, on its own behalf or on
 behalf of the Clinic, contact you on behalf of external business 
partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you.  In
 addition, Vetstreet may share data with trusted partners to help us 
perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide 
customer support, or arrange for deliveries.  All such third parties are
 prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these
 services to Clinic or Vetstreet, and its affiliates, and they are 
required to maintain the confidentiality of your unique personally 
identifiable information.</p>
	  <p>Vetstreet does not use or disclose sensitive personal information,
 such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your 
explicit consent.</p>
	  <p>Vetstreet keeps track of the websites and pages visitors to the 
Website visit within Vetstreet, in order to determine what services are 
the most popular.  This data is used to deliver customized content and 
advertising within the Website to customers whose behavior indicates 
that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
	  <p>We will disclose your unique personally identifiable information, 
without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith 
belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of 
the law or comply with legal process served on the Clinic, Vetstreet or 
the Website; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Vetstreet;
 and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety
 of users of the Website, or the public.</p>
	  <h3>USE OF COOKIES</h3>
	  <p>The Website uses “cookies” to help you personalize your online 
experience.  A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by
 a web page server.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver 
viruses to your computer.  Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can
 only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to 
you.</p>
	  <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
 feature to save you time.  The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web 
server that you have returned to a specific page.  For example, if you 
personalize Website pages, or register with the Website or services 
provided through the Website, a cookie helps the Website to recall your 
specific information on subsequent visits.  This simplifies the process 
of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, 
shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same website, the 
information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily 
use the Website features that you customized.</p>
	  <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.  Most web 
browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your 
browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.  If you choose to 
decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
 features of the Website services or websites you visit.</p>
	  <h3>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
	  <p>We secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use,
 or disclosure and secures the personally identifiable information you 
provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, 
protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.  When personal 
information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other 
websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the 
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
	  <h3>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</h3>
	  <p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect 
company and customer feedback.  We encourage you to periodically review 
this Privacy Statement to be informed of how we are protecting your 
information.</p>
	  <h3>CONTACT INFORMATION</h3>
	  <p>We welcome your comments regarding this Privacy Statement.  If you
 believe that Vetstreet or the Clinic have not adhered to this Privacy 
Statement, please contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@vetstreet.com">webmaster@vetstreet.com</a>.  We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.</p>
